      <h4>Academics</h4>
      <p>
        Ashesi’s core curriculum consists of courses that help students develop the ethics, innovativeness, critical thinking and communication skills necessary for a lifetime career of leadership. By teaching students to explore the connections between different information, separate the relevant from the irrelevant, question assumptions and analyse alternatives, the liberal core serves as a foundation for success and influencing the world. 
      </p>

      <h5>Small class sizes</h5>
      <p>
        Class sizes at Ashesi are kept small, because we believe the best learning takes place when students are able to have deep conversations with their classmates and professors in and out of the classroom. Our classes are full of energy, and students are encouraged to speak up, share ideas and ask critical questions. 

        Our professors care deeply about the success of the students in their classrooms. As leading voices in their areas of expertise, students will find that professors bring strong inspiration to Ashesi’s classes.
